# What is eTin?

You wish to work in a more **quiet** and **peaceful** place where **swearing** out loud is a faraway memory? **eTin** will help you turn those _nasty habits_ on **occasion** to **contribute to actions you care about**! With your team, agree on the amount you will have to pay for each swears you'll dare to pronounce, and choose the association you want to support! 

## How does it work? 

Every user can create their _Tinees_*, and invite his team to participate. There is _no limit_ on the number of participants. The owner of the _Tinee_ can manage _roles_ for each member, giving them availability to also manage, in part, the _Tinee_. 

>*_Tinee represents collect to fund actions, associations. It starts when all members vote ready for it, after agreed on the amount for swearings, the finishing date and/or the maximum amount,  and the associations they want to support_. 

Once the Tinee has **started**, every time someone's _swearing out loud_, he will have to **declare it** in the app. Someone else could also declare it but he will need to _justify with a quote_. 
The Tinee will _keep in memory_ all swearings pronounce by the team, and do the math to resume **who owes what**!
When the _time is up_ or the maximal amount is _exceeded_, members will be invited to **participate in the raising** with Lydia.
